title: Mortgage Protection
description: Mortgage Protection® is a term life insurance policy that offers new and innovative benefits that you won't find in most other policies. Much like traditional term life insurance policies, Mortgage Protection® can help to provide your loved ones with financial protection if you pass away. But it can also provide you with living benefits during your lifetime — when you may need them the most.

whatIsIt: Mortgage insurance, no matter what kind, protects the lender – not you – in the event that you fall behind on your payments. If you fall behind, your credit score may suffer and you can lose your home through foreclosure.
howItWorks: Mortgage insurance lowers the risk to the lender of making a loan to you, so you can qualify for a loan that you might not otherwise be able to get.
subHeading: MPI is a type of insurance policy that helps your family make your monthly mortgage payments if you – the policyholder and mortgage borrower – die before your mortgage is fully paid off.
