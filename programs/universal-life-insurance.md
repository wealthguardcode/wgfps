title: Universal Life Insurance
description: A type of whole life insurance, our Universal Life Insurance policy also offers coverage for up to a lifetime. But there's one key difference between traditional whole life insurance policies and universal life flexibility. Universal Life Insurance lets you adjust the benefit amount to meet your current needs — subject to approval by the life insurance provider — without having to buy a new policy. It can be appropriate for those who are just starting out in life, whether you've just landed your first job or moved into your first apartment. Your financial situation may change over time — and you need a policy that can change along with it.
