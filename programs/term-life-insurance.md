title: Term Life Insurance
description: Traditional Term Life Insurance - One of the most affordable types of life insurance, term life insurance provides you with coverage during the years you need it most (i.e. your selected term). It can be appropriate for those who may have a greater need for coverage now that may diminish over time. Maybe you're starting a family and want peace of mind that they would be financially protected if you were no longer here. Or you've just closed on a new home with your spouse — and want greater coverage until your mortgage is paid off. Term Life Insurance allows you to decide how long you'll need coverage (between 10 to 30 years). It's your life — shouldn't your policy duration be on your terms, too?
